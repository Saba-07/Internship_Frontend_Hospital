<b><u>MISSION:-</b></u><br>
 To provide patient-centered healthcare with excellence in quality, service and access.<br>
<br>
<b><u>VISION:-</b></u><br>
  A community in which all people achieve their full potential for health and well-being across the lifespan.We work to be trusted by patients, a valued partner in the community, and creators of positive change.<br>
<b><u><br>OUR APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE:-</b></u><br>

We care for the whole person, see the complexity of each person�s life, and believe that addressing a broad range of human needs is the best way to improve a person�s health.<br>
We continuously examine the services we provide and what is needed in the community. We look for cracks in the health care system, fill those, and move to fill new ones. When other community resources develop to address those needs, we make intentional decisions to apply our resources differently.<br>
We believe that providing high quality, accessible health care is our reason for being. We seek to be a model for other community health centers.<br>
We use a team approach to providing health care, and involve the patient as part of our team.<br>
<br>
<b><u>OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY:-</b></u><br>

We have a commitment to serving the community and providing open access to Grace Health for all community members.<br>
Involvement by our staff in the community enhances our ability to provide effective health care. Improving the community will improve the health of our customers.<br>
Partnerships with education, government, and other community organizations will multiply the resources for and the effectiveness of our work.<br>
By instilling confidence in our patients, they will become positive forces in the community and contribute to the health of others.<br>
