A health awareness programme was conducted for students from a school in Chennai. The children were sensitized about the importance of washing their hands before and after eating and exercising daily and the importance of playing sports and inculcating other healthy habits to avoid falling sick. The children were asked to share their daily routines and the steps they took every day to maintain hygiene. The children learnt a lot from the session and promised to follow all the good habits.
